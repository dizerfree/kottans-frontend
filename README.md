My impressions of the Front-End Course
===============

Thanks a lot for your program and your help during doing tasks.
I completed all tasks with great interest despite the fact that my English is not good - I use translator and subtitles

1 .  Git and GitHub
----------------
I have finished the course [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

I got familiar with Git and GitHub.

#### The main points for me:

* Use console and **Git** for your local project and use **GitHub** if
you want to collaborate with another developers

* **One commit per logical change**

* **"Detached head"** means you are no longer on a branch,
you have checked out a single commit.
If you have warning: "detached HEAD" you should:
git branch temporary
branch git checkout master
git merge temporary branch

* **Branch early and branch often** ^-^

* The best way to create branch is using command - **git checkout -b name_branch**
That will allow not only create it but also switch to it

* To **resolve a merge conflict** caused by competing line changes,
you must **manually** choose which changes to include from
the different branches in a new commit.

* Use **"git push"** if you want to sent your changes to the remote - GitHub

* Use **"git pull"** if you want to get changes from the remote to your local repo

I learned more useful commands from the course [Learn Git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/):

* **relative refs**: **~ ^** - 
it allows to move to earlier levels in the commit tree

* **cherry-pick** and **rebase** - that allows to copy a series of commits
below your current location

2 .  Linux CLI, HTTP
----------------
I have completed the course [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)
         
Before that, I knew only the basic commands. 
So, there were many new things and useful for me:
* configure own environment 
* alias - allows to create own keyboard shortcuts 
* ls -alt  - shows all contents, including a - hidden files/directories, l - long format, t - date and time last 
modified files
#### Results of Linux CLI, HTTP
![Linux, Command Line](tasks_linux_cli_http/screencapture-codecademy-learn-the-command-line.png)

I have read the articles:

[HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

[HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)       

Many things were difficult to understanding, 
but something has cleared up:
* structure of URLs 
* status Codes and Errors
* Identification and ways of collect personal information
* Authentication and Secure HTTP

3 .  Git for Team Collaboration
----------------
I have completed the courses:
 
[What is Version Control](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/)

[GitHub & Collaboration](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)
         
materials are very useful, but without practice they cannot be understood. 
I will continue to practice, especially I will pay attention to the branches 
and working the remote repository

* media queries
* breakpoints
* responsive patterns and tables

#### New to me:

6 .  JavaScript Basics
-------------------
Thanks to the course [Intro to JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803) from Udacity I 
got a basic knowledge of JavaScript. The way of presenting the materials was  very creative and accessible.
What was new to me?
* special characters
* ternary operator
* global and local scope
* objects

![Results of Intro to JavaScript](task_js_basics/screencapture-classroom-udacity-courses-ud803-2018-12-04-19_48_03.png)

The course [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) from Freecodecamp wasn't easy for me and I often used the 
hints, but there were some things that surprised me:
* arguments object
* regular expressions
* method replace
* method charCodeAt

7 .  Document Object Model
-------------------
I have completed the courses:

[JavaScript и DOM](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud117) from Udacity 

It was new and very interesting for me:
* how to add and change elements
* how to work to elements using browser events
* how to improve code performance

![JavaScript and the DOM](task_js_dom/basics_about_DOM/screencapture-classroom-udacity-courses-ud117-2018-12-13-01_06_52.png)

[freecodecamp Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) 

I have finished this course for motivation - how algorithms should look and how to learn to write them. Therefore, I 
have used tips
